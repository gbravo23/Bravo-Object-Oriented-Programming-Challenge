# Bravo-Object-Oriented-Programming-Challenge

This challenge focused on building a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. My application used 'Jest' for running the unit tests and 'Inquirer' for collecting input from the user. I also created tests for each of the 4 classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer and Intern. 

## The application is invoked by using the following command: 
node index.js

## You can test the 4 classes by using the following command:
npm run test

Please see the link below to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. In the video I ran the 'npm run test' command followed by the 'node index.js' command and ended with opening up the browser to show the generated HTML webpage displaying summaries for the Manager, Engineer and Intern.
